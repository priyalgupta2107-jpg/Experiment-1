Aim: Introduction to Python
Theory: 
a)Data Types in Python:
1. int - stores whole numbers(e.g 10,5)
2. float- stores decimal numbers(e.g,3.14)
3. str - stores text or characters(e.g,"Priyal")
4. bool - stores True or False
   
b)Import statement: It is used to include external modules or libraries in a Pythonb program and allows to use predefined functions and constants.
e.g import math -used to access mathematical functions like log(x),pi,etc.

c)If-Else statements:They are used to make decisions in a program and execute a block of code only when the given condition satisfies.

Algorithm:
1.Start
2.Import necessary library using import statement
3.Input values of variables a and b
4.Calculate:
Sum = a + b
Difference = a - b
Product = a * b
Quotient = a / b
5.If a > b, display "a is greater than b"
Else, display "b is greater than or equal to a".
6.Declare variable r for radius.
7.Calculate area using formula:
Area = π × r × r
Display the area of the circle.
Stop
End

Conclusion:
Python allows easy use of data types, import statements, mathematical operations, and if–else conditions to write simple, clear, and efficient programs for problem solving.
